* Chapter 9 Single CPU Scheduling
    ** Student Lecture [2025-4-24 Thu]
        *** Types of Processor Schedule 
            - Long-term, medium-term, short-term 
            - long-term: from disk, new to ready, slowest 
            - medium-term: swaps current executing process from main memory to disk, faster than long-term, slower-than short term, more control, lowers degree of multiprogramming 
            - short-term: fastestm also known as the dispatcher 
        
        *** Scheduling Algorithms 
            - objective is to allocate processor time optimizing certain aspects of system behavior.
